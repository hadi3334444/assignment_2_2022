# The First Package

This is the first package that you have to download or clone it into a folder then you have to create a package inside your ros_ws/src folder using the following command:

*catkin_create_pkg* *assignment_2_2022* *rospy*

And then you have to copy and replace all the files and folders that already downloaded and you have first package ready.

Now you can go to my second repository, by the name of **secondassign.git** and read *README.md* file to successfully run the code. I am also writing the link of my second repository just copy it into your browser.
